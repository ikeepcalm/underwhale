# Underwhale

Final project for course "Algorithms Designing" KPI 121 2-nd year 

Undertale-alike mini-game made using FXGL, implementing simple mini-game with Flowey. Mini game itself is very similar to "Black Jack", but instead of cards we have dice - whoever will be closer to 21, while not exceeding it will win.
